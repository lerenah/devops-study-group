# Tetra

Tetra is installed by the **dotool** bootstrap process. In other words, if you use `dotool-create-node` you will have a virtual private server configured with `/home/devops/tetra/tetra-custom.sh` which was generated by `dotool-create-node`.


## The Nodeholder Process
1. Obtain an Digital Ocean API Key
2. Install [doctl](https://github.com/digitalocean/doctl) on your local machine
3. Clone [devops-study-group](https://study-groups/devops-study-group) into `~/src/devops-study-group` 
4. source `~/src/devops-study-group/dotool.sh`

5. `dotool-create name`
  - will create an LTS node with hostname name. 
  - add IP info into the ~/server.list file

6. ssh root@$name
  - Clone [devops-study-group](https://study-groups/devops-study-group)
    into /root/src/devops-study-group
  - source ~/src/devops-study-group/tetra/tetra-init.sh
